## üñ•Ô∏è‚ÄÉHiya, I'm Thomas!‚ÄÉüéâ

I'm a technologist, Python developer, writer and citizen based in London. For the last 10 years, I've worked agency-side in leadership roles with some of the largest science, finance and private innovation companies in Europe. As well as being a hands-on developer, I'm also an experienced digital operations lead and technical product owner, and have led distributed teams of ~20 across multiple disciplines, countries and timezones.

I'm interested in innovation, creativity, technology for social good, and political theory!
