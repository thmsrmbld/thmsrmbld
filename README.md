## 🖥️ Hiya, I'm Thomas! 🎉

I'm a technologist, Python developer, writer and citizen based in London. For the last 10 years, I've worked agency-side in leadership roles with some of the largest science, finance and private innovation companies in Europe. As well as being a hands-on developer, I'm also an experienced digital operations lead and technical product owner, and have led distributed teams of ~20 across multiple disciplines, countries and timezones.

I'm interested in innovation, creativity, technology for social good, and political theory!

* HTML5, CSS & JavaScript, with some [ReactJS][]
* AWS, Digital Ocean and [Terraform][] for deployments
* [Docker][], [Docker Compose][]
* [Git][], Github & Gitlab

### 🌱 Things I'm currently learning more about:

* Anything to do with Python

### 🖊️  Other fun stuff 

* I'm usually in the 🇬🇧 London area, but I travel a bit
