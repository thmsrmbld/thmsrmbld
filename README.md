## 🖥️ Hiya, I'm Thomas! 🎉

I'm a technologist, Python developer, writer and citizen based in London. For the last 10 years, I've worked agency-side in leadership roles with some of the largest science, finance and private innovation companies in Europe. As well as being a hands-on developer, I'm also an experienced digital operations lead and technical product owner, and have led distributed teams of ~20 across multiple disciplines, countries and timezones.

I'm interested in innovation, creativity, technology for social good, and political theory!

### 💻  You'll mostly find me working with...

* [Python][], [Django][] & [Django Rest Framework][]
* HTML5, CSS & JavaScript, with some [ReactJS][]
* AWS, Digital Ocean and [Terraform][] for deployments
* [Docker][], [Docker Compose][]
* [Git][], Github & Gitlab

### 🌱 Things I'm currently learning more about:

* Anything to do with Python
* Docker, Compose and container orchestration for Devops-style work
* Data-intensive web-application design
* Data science libraries in Python

### 🤓  I've also got a little personal site: https://thomaskr.online/
(It's custom-built using [Miniterm][], my open-source, in-browser Bash terminal emulator. You can check it out by using the 'ls' command to list the commands it comes with, and even fork your own version if you want to!)
